Mailvat is a simple plugin that catches outgoing mail while working in your development environment.

This plugin supports Mailpit and MailHog, but this is NOT an official plugin from any of those. This is just a simple plugin that helps you route outgoing emails to a development SMTP service.

## Description

Mailvat routes all your outgoing emails to your SMTP service for easy local development.

My recommendation is to use [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) in your development environment with this plugin.

This is an UNOFFICIAL plugin that just integrates Mailpit or MailHog in WordPress.

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin folder to the plugins directory, e.g. the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Optionally: Configure your Mailpit SMTP settings by using the `MAILVAT_HOST` and `MAILVAT_PORT` constants
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Mailvat is a simple plugin that integrates your SMTP testing tool, like Mailpit or MailHog, with WordPress.

### What is Mailpit?

[Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) is a nice email testing tool for developers. All outgoing emails from your website end up in the inbox in Mailpit, instead of being sent to the original recipients. This helps us testing our emails.

### How can I use this plugin?

### What are the plugin's default configuration values?

If you do not define the `MAILVAT_HOST` and `MAILVAT_PORT` constants yourself, these will be used by default:

MAILVAT_HOST=mailpit
MAILVAT_PORT=1025

### Is this an official plugin from Mailpit or MailHog?

This is NOT an official plugin from the creators of Mailpit or MailHog. I am not related to anyone in the Mailpit or the MailHog team.

This is just a simple plugin to easily use an SMTP service, like Mailpit or MailHog, with WordPress. I made this plugin because I could not find it yet and it speeds up our local development if we can easily install this integration in WordPress.
